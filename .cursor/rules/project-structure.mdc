# Personal Timeline Website Project

## Project Overview
This is a personal timeline website built with vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript that tells a life story through six interactive chapters with smooth animations and a dark blue-dominant design.

## Key Files
- [index.html](mdc:index.html) - Main HTML structure with six timeline sections
- [styles.css](mdc:styles.css) - CSS with Warm Autumn Glow color scheme and responsive design
- [script.js](mdc:script.js) - JavaScript for scroll animations and timeline interactions
- [personal-timeline-website.plan.md](mdc:personal-timeline-website.plan.md) - Project documentation and status
- [assets/](mdc:assets/) - Directory for pencil-drawing-style illustrations

## Design System
- **Color Scheme**: Dark blue-dominant Warm Autumn Glow palette
  - Primary: Deep blue (#003049) - dominant background
  - Secondary: Vibrant red (#D62828) - accents
  - Accent: Bright orange (#F77F00) - highlights
  - Highlight: Golden yellow (#FCBF49) - active elements
  - Background: Creamy beige (#EAE2B7) - card backgrounds
- **Layout**: Left-aligned timeline with compact responsive design
- **No gradients**: Solid colors throughout for clean appearance

## Development Guidelines
- Use CSS variables for color consistency
- Maintain responsive design (max-width: 900px desktop, 800px tablet)
- Timeline sections use illustration placeholders ready for pencil drawings
- All animations use smooth transitions with cubic-bezier easing
- JavaScript uses Intersection Observer for scroll-triggered animations
